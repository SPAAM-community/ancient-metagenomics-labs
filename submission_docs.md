# Contributing to Ancient Metagenomics Labs

**Hello, and thank you for contributing to the SPAAM community's Ancient Metagenomics Labs initiative!**

This is a community curated registry of ancient metagenomics labs.

The purpose of this registry to promote further collaboration between labs by making labs working in ancient metagenomics more visible.
We hope this will help with identifying:

- Collaborators
- Thesis committee members
- Publication reviewers
- Future academic employers
- Experts for interviews

So, if you are any form of researcher in ancient metagenomics (whether that is a student, postdoc, or PI), please take a moment to do the following:

1. Read through this table on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OM9po5TB98y0JwJmGU0EZ0qt6W8ZiMY7SmEfNq0FCnc/edit?usp=sharing).
   - _If you cannot access Google Drive_, please review the [table](/#the-registry-of-ancient-metagenomic-labs) on this website and email any change requests to SPAAM steering committee at [spaam.community@gmail.com](mailto:spaam.community@gmail.com).
2. Look for both your own lab (whether one you lead, or are a member of) and any others that you know!
3. Find a lab you recognise (yours, or another)?
   - üéâ Great! Please check the info in the entry is correct.
   - ‚úÖ If you make a change, please update the 'Status' (first) column to 'Updated'.
4. Can't find your lab (or you know of another that is missing)?
   - üí™ Oh no! Please add it to the list as a new entry at the bottom!
   - üóÉÔ∏è Double check the [requirements](#requirements-for-being-listed) for listing
   - ‚úâÔ∏è Make sure to include the PI's email address (last column, 'IF NEW email address of PI') so the project coordinator can check they are OK with being listed

P.S. Please take the country from the [INSDC controlled list](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/geo_loc_name-qualifier-vocabulary/)  
P.P.S. Latitude/Longitude should be Google Maps coordinates of the institution the lab is within!

## Requirements for being listed

The lab must:

- Must actively work on ancient metagenomics (e.g. ancient pathogens, ancient microbiomes, ancient metagenomics, sedaDNA etc.)
  - Examples of evidence of active work:
    - Publications
    - Grants
    - Projects listed on their website
    - Students dedicated to a project involving ancient metagenomics
- Must have a dedicated web-presence (e.g. webpage)
